                                <p>&mdash; Svitolina has won 15 WTA singles titles, including the 2018 WTA Finals and
                                    three of five Premier 5-level tournaments in 2017: the Dubai Tennis Championships,
                                    the Italian Open, and the Canadian Open. At the 2015 French Open she reached her
                                    first Grand Slam quarterfinal, where she was defeated by former champion Ana
                                    Ivanovic. In February 2017, after winning the title in Dubai, Svitolina became the
                                    first Ukrainian woman to break into the top-10 rankings. Svitolina would finally
                                    reach her first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2019 Wimbledon Championships and
                                    followed it up with a second consecutive semifinal at the 2019 US Open.</p>

                                        defeating qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich in the final.[18] She then competed at
                                        the Australian Open as the fourth seed. She faced qualifier Ivana Jorović and
                                        won in straight sets. Against Kateřina Siniaková, Svitolina prevailed in three
                                        sets. She then had two straight-sets wins over qualifier and compatriot Marta

                                        defeating Victoria Duval, Karolína Plíšková, and Jarmila Wolfe. Svitolina and
                                        Dolgopolov were the winners of their group, and advanced to the final, where the
                                        Australian pairing of Nick Kyrgios and Daria Gavrilova defeated them 2–0, with
                                        Svitolina losing her singles match in straight sets. At the Sydney
                                        International, Svitolina lost in the first round to Angelique Kerber. In
                                        Melbourne, she defeated Victoria Duval in straight sets, before losing to
